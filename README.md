# GDSCript Syntax Highlight

## Fork of DinDeprecated's fork. Updated for Godot 4.0, and can handle more of the syntax. 
Unsure of performance, a few more rules were added. Updated to Highlightjs 11, though some may still be outdated, I'm not that familiar with it!

### Usage
Used to highlight GDScript syntax on HTML.

To use it, include these first in the head tags:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@highlightjs/cdn-assets@11.9.0/styles/default.min.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@highlightjs/cdn-assets@11.9.0/highlight.min.js"></script>
```

Then you can use the css and highlightjs script in this repo.
